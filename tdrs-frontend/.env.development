# Setup SCSS:
# The following makes it possible to import SASS modules
# without relative paths. Removing this will require all @imports in
# .scss files to be made with relative paths, like '../../node_modules/my_package'
# Presently both of these are possible (in an .scss file):
#  @import 'theme/_global.scss';
#  @import '../../theme/_global.scss';
# Without the variable, only the relative import is possible
