/**
 * This action fires an HTTP GET request to the API
 * to determine whether a user is authenticated.
 *
 * This is imported into index.js and called every time
 * the window is loaded.
 *
 * This call is made with `withCredentials` to include
 * HTTP_ONLY cookies, which contain the encrypted auth token info.
 *
 * If the API responds with `data` in the body and a `user` object,
 * then SET_AUTH is dispatched, setting the authenticated state
 * in the Redux store. This tells the app whether or not the user
 * is signed in.
 *
 * If there is no `user` object in the response `data`,
 * the user is NOT authenticated, and CLEAR_AUTH is dispatched.
 *
 * CLEAR_AUTH is idempotent, and will not harm anything
 * if the user is already signed out. If the user is signed in,
 * CLEAR_AUTH removes the user info from the Redux store,
 * and sets `authenticated: false`, telling the app the user
 * is NOT logged in and shall not access private routes.
 *
 * If an API error occurs, SET_AUTH_ERROR is dispatched
 * and the error is set in the Redux store, and the user remains
 * logged out. If the user is already logged in, and if an error occurs,
 * the authentication data in the Redux store is cleared, and the user
 * is considered 'logged out', and can no longer access private routes.
