# Frontend for TDP

Frontend API Service for TDP. Deployed to Cloud.gov at https://tdp-frontend.app.cloud.gov/ . The project uses [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) and in particular, [trussworks/react-uswds](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds)

# Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)  
- [Login.gov Sandbox Account](https://idp.int.identitysandbox.gov/sign_up/enter_email)
- [Cloud.gov Account](https://cloud.gov/)
- [Cloud Foundry CLI](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html)

# Contents

- [Local Development Options](#Local-Development-Options)
- [Code Linting and Formatting](#Code-Linting-and-Formatting)
- [Unit and Integration Testing](#Unit-and-Integration-Testing)
- [Manual Cloud.gov Deployments](#Manual-Cloud.gov-Deployments)

# Running the Frontend locally:

  **Login is now dependent on the [tdrs-backend](../tdrs-backend/README.md#testing-the-local-backend-service) service. You will need a local instance of that application running.**

### Local Development:

Execute the command below from `tdrs-frontend/` folder to access the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build -d
```

The above command will bring up two docker containers

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                            PORTS                    NAMES

```

### Environment Variables
The TDP frontend utilizes built in Create React App (CRA) handling for environment variables which leverages multiple `.env` files:
* `.env`: Default.
* `.env.local`: Local overrides. This file is loaded for all environments except test.
* `.env.development`, `.env.test`, `.env.production`: Environment-specific settings.
* `.env.development.local`, `.env.test.local`, `.env.production.local`: Local overrides of environment-specific settings.

All of these `.env` files can be checked in to source control, with the exception of `.local` overrides and provided that they contain no *secrets*.

The order of inheritance for env files depends on how the application was built/launched.

#### Docker
When running this app with Docker on localhost React will assign `NODE_ENV=development` and use this inheritance order:
* .env.development.local
* .env.local
* .env.development
* .env

#### `npm start`
When running this app directly on localhost React will assign `NODE_ENV=development` and use this inheritance order:
* Any variables set directly on host machine (ie. export MY_VAR=...)
* .env.development.local
* .env.local
* .env.development
* .env

#### `npm test`
During tests, the env files are loaded in this order:
* .env.test.local
* .env.test
* .env

#### CircleCI
The current CircleCI config utilizes npm to build and test the frontend application. As such it follows this order of inheritance for environment variables:
* Any variables set directly in CircleCI Project Settings
* .env.test.local
* .env.test
* .env

[See CRA documentation for more info](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/#adding-development-environment-variables-in-env)

### Code Linting and Formatting

The app is set up with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), and follows the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

To run eslint locally:
```bash
$ npm run lint
```

If you use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), it will be helpful to add the extensions, [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) and [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). These make it possible to catch lint errors as they occur, and even auto-fix style errors (with Prettier).

----

### Unit and Accessibility Testing

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests and [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) for automated accessibility tests.

**Unit Tests with Jest**

Jest provides an interactive test console that's helpful for development. After running the following commands, you will see options to run all the tests, run only failing tests, run specific tests, and more.


1.) To run unit tests locally:
  ```bash
  $ npm run test
  ```
2.) To run unit tests with code coverage report:
  ```bash
  $ npm run test:cov
  ```
3.) To run unit tests as a continuous integration environment would, which runs the tests once (without the interactive console):
  ```bash
  $ npm run test:ci
  ```

After running either `test:cov` or `test:ci`, coverage details can be seen as HTML in the browser by running:
```bash
$ open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

In addition to [Jest's matchers](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect), this project uses [enzyme-matchers](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/enzyme-matchers) to simplify tests and make them more readable. Enzyme matchers is integrated with Jest using the [`jest-enzyme` package](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/enzyme-matchers/blob/master/packages/jest-enzyme/README.md#assertions) which provides many useful assertions for testing React components.

### Cloud.gov Deployments:

Although CircleCi is [set up to auto deploy](../.circleci/config.yml#L131) frontend and backend to Cloud.gov, if there is a need to do a manual deployment, the instructions below can be followed:

1.) Log into your cloud.gov account and set your space and organization:

##### - **ORG: The target deployment organization as defined in cloud.gov Applications** 

##### - **SPACE: The target deployment space under the organization as defined in cloud.gov Applications**
```bash
$ cf login -a api.fr.cloud.gov --sso
$ cf target -o <ORG> -s <SPACE-1>
```

You may be prompted to select from a list of spaces under the selected target. Please follow the prompt to select your intended deployment space


Example Prompt:
```
Targeted org hhs-acf-prototyping.

Select a space:
1. <SPACE-1>
2. <SPACE-2>

Space (enter to skip): 1
Targeted space <SPACE-1>.
```

2.) Push the image to Cloud.gov (  you will need to be in the same directory as`tdrs-frontend/manifest.yml`):

```bash
 cf push tdp-frontend -f manifest.yml
```

4.) To apply any changes made to environment variables you will need to restage the application:

```bash
$ cf restage tdp-frontend
```
