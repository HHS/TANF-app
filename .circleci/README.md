# CICD Walkthrough

This app mainly uses CircleCi for cicd. GitHub actions is used to trigger some CircleCi pipelines, such as deploying on label and qasp scans.

## Dynamic Configuration

To make the config yaml easier to read we are using CircleCi's [Dynamic Configuration](https://circleci.com/docs/dynamic-config/) feature.

### Continuation orb
CicleCi has an orb that allows for another config file to be specified. Using a script this new config is generated based on the info passed via the pipeline parameters. This can later be used in conjuction with the path filtering orb to make our build time shorter. It could also be used to build different configuration files for different pipelines.
#### generate_config.sh
This script will generate a complete config for building, testing, and deploying.

### Directory structure

#### build-and-test
Contains workflows, jobs, and commands for building and testing the application.

#### infrastructure
Contains workflows, jobs, and commands for setting up the infrastructure on Cloud gov.

#### deployment
Contains workflows, jobs, and commands for deploying the application on Cloud gov.

#### owasp
Contains workflows, jobs, and commands for running OWASP scans on the application in during the pipeline against Cloud.gov environments.

#### util
Contains utility workflows like `cf-check` that are reused in different versions of the generated_config.yml as to have access to these common functions. It also has one-offs like `erd`.

### Navigation examples
What if you want to look at the jobs that we used to build and test the application?

This is easy. We first go to the `build-and-test` directory then open the jobs.yml

`build-and-test/ -> jobs.yml`

<hr />

What if you want to know how Terraform is used by our pipeline?

Terraform is used to set up infrastruture so we would start in the `infrastructure` directory. To see how terraform is actualy used you would look in commands since that is generally where Circle Ci actually runs things. Within the `deploy-infrastructure` command in the commands.yml you can see that a terraform orb is beign used to run terraform commands.

`infrastructure/ -> commands.yml -> deploy-infrastructure`

<hr />

What if you want to know how the deployments are triggered?

We know we want the `deployments` directory. To see how a pipeline is started we look at workflow.yml. Then we find the desired workflow.

`deployment/ -> workflows.yml -> desired workflow`

## Setting up scheduled pipeline for nightly OWASP scans
We want a scheduled pipeline that runs once a day with the pipeline parameter `run_nightly_owasp_scan` set to `true`. You can use [these instructions](https://circleci.com/docs/scheduled-pipelines/#project-settings) from the docs or follow the instructions below.

In Circle Ci go to `Project Settings -> Triggers -> Add Triggers`

You want the Trigger Source to be scheduled.

You want Repeats to be weekly.

You want to select all for days and months.

You want the start time to be at 0:00 UTC.

You want to repeat once per hour.

You want to set the branch to be the branch you want this scan to be run on.

You want to add a Pipeline Parameter with `run_nightly_owasp_scan`to be a boolean and set to `true`.

You want Attribution set to Scheduled Actor (Scheduling System)
