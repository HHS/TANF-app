## SC-20 - SECURE NAME / ADDRESS RESOLUTION SERVICE (AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE)

The information system:  
a. Provides additional data origin authentication and integrity verification artifacts along with the authoritative name resolution data the system returns 
in response to external name/address resolution queries; and  
b. Provides the means to indicate the security status of child zones and (if the child supports secure resolution services) to enable verification of a chain 
of trust among parent and child domains, when operating as part of a distributed, hierarchical namespace.  

### TDP Implementation

TDP does not provide domain name resolution services. This is inherited from cloud.gov.
