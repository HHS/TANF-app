## Our Vendor Acquisition Process
1. Conducted user research and discovery
2. Created a [draft RFQ](https://github.com/18F/tdrs-app-rfq/tree/main/Draft-RFQ) and shared publicly for comments from interested vendors
3. Released [the final RFQ](https://github.com/18F/tdrs-app-rfq/tree/main/Final-RFQ) to 11 vendors.
4. Issued a modification to incorporate answers to questions received and modify the RFQ in response to those questions.
5. Evaluated responses to RFQ and made an award decision to Raft!
