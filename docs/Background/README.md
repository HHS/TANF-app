# Project Background

Herein you will find background information about the Administration for Children and Families ([ACF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/)) and the [TANF](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/programs/temporary-assistance-needy-families-tanf) program, as well as additional context about the legacy system (TDRS) that TDP will replace. 

In the early stages of this project, 18F developed an initial prototype  to test assumptions about the primary goal of this project. The prototype has been moved to an [archived repo](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app-archive).
