# Welcome

Hi hello! Welcome to the project docs for the New TANF Data Reporting System (New TDRS)! This is where we keep our background, design, and development documentation.

Our vision is to build a new, secure, web-based data reporting system to improve the federal reporting experience for TANF grantees and federal staff. The new system will allow grantees to easily submit accurate data and be confident that they have fulfilled their reporting requirements. This will reduce the burden on all users, improve data quality, lead to better policy and program decision-making, and ultimately help low-income families.
