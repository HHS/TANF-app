# Meeting Norms 

- For all recurring team meetings and standups use OFA WebEx in the invite. Zoom or Google Meet is okay for ad hoc conversations. 
- If you have background noise, mute your mic. 
- Try not to talk over others.  
- If you are creating a new meeting invite, please be explicit include an goal/outcome in the meeting invite. What do we hope to accomplish in that time? 
- OFA and Raft both use Outlook and 18F uses Google Calendar. Generally, cross-platform calendar invites work okay. However, if you modify an existing meeting--especially a recurring meeting--double check that the invitees got the update.
