# Welcome to the TDP User Experience (UX) Directory 

TDP is being developed for its core users. To that end, we follow an iterative design process backed by rigorous generative and evaluative research.  We listen to our users' needs - both STT and OFA- and build functionality that not only fulfils, but also eases their data prepping and transmission requirements. 

The UX approach for TDP is derived from industry best practices, accessibility standards and government compliance requirements.

This directory includes the following research- and design-related docs and resources:

### Research
- The **[Research Roadmap](https://app.mural.co/t/raft2792/m/raft2792/1627058877512/7514d3617f4bc241d3f70ff6e61253e1ce09f880?sender=mreiter1745)** is a living document created to support our agile processes and approach to release planning in the post-ATO phase of the TDP project we're now in. It is closely aligned to the [product roadmap](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/Product-Strategy/Roadmap-and-Backlog.md) and its goals include:
  - Support the overall team's alignment on *what* needs to be researched and delivered to support functionality in the product roadmap.
  - Support the design team in determining research strategy.
  - Support the design team in pre-planning research to reduce the planning lift of prioritizing any given research topic.
- **[User Research guide](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/User-Research-Guide.md)** - covers practices and considerations for ensuring participant privacy and safety (including psychological safety).
- **[Research Syntheses](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/Research-Syntheses)** - Folder for storing findings from user research sessions. This includes an overview of **_[Stakeholder types and Personas](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/Research-Syntheses/2020%2C%20Summer%20-%20Understanding%20Stakeholders%20and%20creating%20personas.md)_** in use on the project.

### Design 
- **[Design principles](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/Design-Principles.md)** - is an overview of the guidelines we're using to design TDP.
- **[Style guide](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/Style-Guide.md)** - is an overview of the design tools and styling parameters for TDP.
- **[Dev-ready designs](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/Dev-Ready-Designs)** - Folder for storing high fidelity final design mockups that will serve as the basis for feature development.

### Additional resources
- **[UX markdown practices](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/UX-markdown-practices.md)** - Includes guidance for structuring UX-related documents stored herein this directory.
