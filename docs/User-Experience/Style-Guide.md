# Content guide

We're continuing to learn about the content needs of the new TDRS. Future teams should plan to write in plain language and continually test site navigation and comprehension. Documentation in code docs should ensure that usage of TANF-related terms remains consistent with the definitions found in the Project Glossary.

**Resources:**

* [ACF content guide](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/digital-toolbox/content)
* [plainlanguage.gov](https://plainlanguage.gov/)
* [18F content guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/)
* [Project Glossary](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/Background/Project-Glossary.md)

# Accessibility

Everyone who works on government websites has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive. The new TDRS should meet 508 accessibility standards and use accessible design and development best practices.

**Resources:**

* [Accessibility for teams](https://accessibility.digital.gov/)
* [18F Accessibility guide](https://accessibility.18f.gov/)
* [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/)

# Visual styling

## ACF styles

Information on existing ACF styles can be found in the [ACF Digital Toolbox](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/digital-toolbox)

## U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)

We'll be using  [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/), a design system for the federal government, for the new TANF Data Portal (TDP). USWDS provides us with UX guidance and code for [common UI components](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/) as well as [guidance on how to comply with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experiences Act (IDEA)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/?dg).

# Figma artifacts

## User flows

To improve our workflow in ideating and supporting development, we created a [user flows page](<https://www.figma.com/file/irgQPLTrajxCXNiYBTEnMV/TDP-Mockups-For-Feedback?node-id=1277%3A8087>) in Figma to map and explore user actions and outcomes in a modular environment that can be easily changed and extended. 

This living document covers actions a user would take, system actions that happen on the backend, and destinations that are reached after actions are executed. To communicate how these actions and outcomes intertwine, we included primary and secondary paths that a user can take within the flow. These flows have also proven useful for certain security/compliance workflow documentation needs.
