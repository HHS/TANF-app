# Research Syntheses

With a few exceptions, we've tended to publish markdown research syntheses to summarize larger, multi-sprint research activities and studies rather than publishing individual documents for each research session

The syntheses included herein are organized reverse-chronologically from newest to oldest:

- A total of 17 states, 17 tribes and two territories participated in the pilot expansion using the production version of TDP to submit their FY2023 Q1 data files.
- Conducted a retrospective on the usability of Django (system admin) as the TDP user base continues to expand and what might the System Admins need to keep up with onboarding, and managing users and logs at scale.

- Ran a series of collaborative workshops with DIGIT and OFA regional staff to prioritize and sort which attributes should be displayed at the top level of submission history pages in TDP and capture preferences around the minimum viable attributes to be displayed.
- Ran a series of research sessions with grantees to investigate the impact of partial resubmission no longer being accepted in TDP and capture grantee preferences around minimum viable attributes on the Submission History page.
- Evaluated whether grantees understood new submission status states (Accepted, Accepted with errors, and Rejected) and correctly predict what their next steps would be to act on those statuses.


### [2021, Summer - Communicating Errors in TDP & Validations With Regional Staff](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/blob/develop/docs/User-Experience/Research-Syntheses/2021%2C%20Summer%20-%20Communicating%20Errors%20in%20TDP%20%26%20Validations%20With%20Regional%20Staff.md)

- Ran collaborative workshops with DIGIT to capture the full scope of pre-parsing errors that could prevent TDRS/TDP from being able to process grantee files.
  - Content tested three errors with grantees to identify do's and don'ts and generally investigate which factors determine whether an error is understandable and actionable for grantee data analysts who will receive them.
- Ran collaborative workshops to capture insights from OFA regional staff regarding their roles and responsibilities
  - Began investigating the grantee information regional staff would need to be able to administrate grantee user access in their region; how to make this process secure as well as operationally simple.
