### Cross-grantee collaboration regarding TANF policy and data mostly happens in the context of conferences.

Participants indicated that they would be happy to assist other grantees if they were asked for help in something, but nodded to conferences as being the primary way in which this happens. 

> "We would assist if asked. We also participate in the annual [case management system] User Conference."

**Project Impact(s)**

- The design team refined journey maps to focus more specifically on the core grantee journey for data cleansing and submission; ending at the use of TANF data at the grantee level rather than best practice sharing across grantees which seems to be more tangential to the data process.
- A future validation could examine how we might encourage community-sourced support around TDP and TANF Reporting.


---

### Tribes don't receive transmission reports and lack sufficient communication of whether or not they've satisfied reporting requirements each quarter.

Multiple participants indicated that the auto-reply email they receive from the fTANF mailbox is the only email regarding the status of their quarterly submission that they receive. They told us that it was difficult to know what to expect when reaching out to OFA as well; citing that they don't always hear back about questions sent to the federal level and that their experience varies significantly depending on the contact they reach out to. They did note that emails from OFA with reports (like the one for WPR) are faster now than they have been in past years. 

> "I need a more direct way to get the file to ACF"
>
> "[All I get] is the auto-reply that the email was received"
>
> "A portal like this would create consistency between tribes whereas currently each tribe gets different information"
>
> "I have never received confirmation [that] my data has been validated."
>
> "quicker feedback will help me correct misperceptions before it was too late"

**Project Impact(s)**

- We prioritized concept testing of notification events during the sprint to better evaluate what "sufficient" communication is and how we might achieve it in TDP.


---

### The Tribes we interviewed use vendor software for both TANF data and data relating to other public programs much like integrated eligibility systems we've seen from States and Territories.

Some Tribes have been invested in [particular case management systems] for most of the existence of the TANF program.

> "Case data is entered at site level and pulled from [system] database."
>
> "All case data is loaded into [system] database. From there for each quarter we run the data to check for errors [in separate data reporting tool] before sending to ACF for approval."
>
> "Our system tells us if we have errors before we transmit [and] errors are corrected prior to pulling the data from [system] to report."

Just as we heard from some participants during [Fall 2020 Research](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/2020%2C%20Fall%20-%20Understanding%20STT%20Roles%2C%20Source%20of%20Truth%2C%20and%20Metadata.md), some tribes have been managing their   human services programs in one software solution for the better part of twenty years—often in software structured modularly like other integrated eligibility systems we've seen from participants representing States and Territories. At least two of the tools in use by Tribes still rely on fTANF to produce the final report files. 

> "We have had [system] for 19 years"
>
> "...it also includes modules for other programs like childcare services [...] we have five modules"
>
> "fTANF converts the cases into the .txt file for us"

**Project Impact(s)**

- We've captured contact information for [vendor] representatives for the purposes of follow-on research. This could be an important way to identify differences from State and Territory systems, implications of those differences on data quality, and aid in identifying effective ways for TDP to facilitate better data quality. 
- We plan to further investigate what format these systems export data in; given that fTANF is still a part of the workflow. This could impact what alternate file types/formats TDP might accept and parse in the future. 


---

### Some Tribes use separate data reporting or analytics software to supplement case management tools.

Participants told us they use [system] to generate a variety of reports from TANF data which are used both for error correction/data cleansing and for other grantee level objectives. These include reports such as the Work Participation Rate (WPR) and possibly extends to those regarding population characteristics, longitudinal analytics, and the efficacy evaluations of TANF programs. Participants also noted that certain reporting systems are sometimes "bundled" with case management tools. 

> "The [reporting system lets us] customize to whatever data we want"
>
> "[our reports include those] that identify errors before submission"
>
> "I determine the [report] parameters"
>
> "We use [system], a comprehensive case management program and use [reporting system] to extract data. [Our case management system] creates our FTANF report."

**Project Impact(s)**

- A top future validation discussed in the Synthesis Workshop concerns seeking more clarity on what these reports look like, what component data points make them up, and whether there's value in TDP being able to generate some of them.


---

### "How might we create a more secure way to transfer data files?" was identified by Workshop 1 participants as their top priority. 

The security shortcomings of the current state (text file transmission via email) seem clear to participants, at least when prompted with the opportunity framing the newer system as *more* secure. 

> "Will there be encryption?"
>
> "More of the file [than has it today] needs encryption (for PII reasons)"
>
> "We don't use password encryption because you have to send the password in a insecure email format as well"

Participants expressed some concern about whether the new system would require investment of IT resources, technical training, or more broadly duplicate work for data analysts. 

> "Is there a secure connection we would need to do on our end [to plug into new TDP security]"
>
> "Firewall limitations that are from the [IT] department could make it difficult to access"
>
> "Depends on the IT department and [their] policies"
>
> "If [the new TANF Data Portal] doesn't align with our current system, we would be duplicating data-entry."

We should be conscious of the variety of ways in which our STT users are required to interface with existing technology systems. Participants told us that they're already required to maintain log-ins for multiple systems; tribal, state, and federal. Some systems have VPN requirements in addition to security measures such as frequent password resets. One of the federal systems mentioned was grants.gov so it's possible that other users who feel somewhat overwhelmed by account juggling might be able to utilize existing accounts. Grants.gov allows login.gov authenticated login, but also includes other methods including PIV / CAC and HSPD-12 HHS cards. 

> "Why do I have to log into multiple portals and maintain multiple login in credentials?"
>
> "I have state and tribal logins"
>
> "I don't like going through the process of changing my password"

**Project Impact(s)**

- Another top future validation would examine what processes grantees are currently used to when it comes to managing the access of their workers to existing federal and state systems so as to introduce non-burdensome access policies around TDP.

### We validated the value of three notification events as well as the hypothesis that a reminder of reporting due dates could be helpful.

Our Kano model analysis of all three notification events:

- "TANF Data for [Quarter] has been submitted!" 
- "TANF data for [Quarter] requires changes!"
- "TANF data for [Quarter] has been accepted!"

All three events fall into the "Must-be" category; basic requirements needed to meet user expectations. Participants voted that each notification event was "Extremely important", something they would expect to receive, and something that they would dislike *not* receiving. 

| Notification Expectation Votes                              | I like it            | I expect it          | I am neutral         | I can tolerate it    | I dislike it         |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Functional**                                              |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |
| How would you feel if you received this notification?       | :heavy_check_mark: 1 | :heavy_check_mark: 5 |                      |                      | :heavy_check_mark: 1 |
| **Dysfunctional**                                           |                      |                      |                      |                      |                      |
| How would you feel if you DIDN'T receive this notification? |                      |                      | :heavy_check_mark: 1 | :heavy_check_mark: 1 | :heavy_check_mark: 5 |

| Notification Importance Votes       | Not at all important | Somewhat important | I am neutral         | Very Important       | Extremely Important  |
| :---------------------------------- | :------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- | :------------------- |
| **Importance**                      |                      |                    |                      |                      |                      |
| How important is this notification? |                      |                    | :heavy_check_mark: 1 | :heavy_check_mark: 1 | :heavy_check_mark: 5 |

Participants attributed the value these notification events provide as primarily being about knowing whether they still have work to do and about standardizing when and how that's communicated across all tribes including for audit trail purposes.

> "This communication would be helpful to have in the portal as well for consistency in communication between all tribes."
>
> "[I want] confirmation that I have completed my task and I can move on to my other tasks"
>
> "The notifications are important because auditors have been asking for confirmation of qtrly reports"

They also told us that reminders of when data is due each quarter could be valuable.

> "Reminder a week prior of the day that the report is due each quarter."

One participant went on to note that in addition to due dates, they might want a notification for when new national data is available at the ACF website. 

> "[I want to be notified of] when national data is available at ACF website"

While participants expected these notifications, it's worth noting that also being able to access the insights they provide *within* TDP may be expected or appreciated. 

> "It would be nice to see the data submission information status in the system versus receiving an e-mail"

### We validated that grantees would like to be able to download files they've submitted to TDP.

| Download Expectation Votes                                   | I like it            | I expect it          | I am neutral         | I can tolerate it    | I dislike it         |

### A/B Lo-Fi Concept Testing Results

Participants did not express significant preferences between variations. The concern they expressed for security seemed to be about whether a new portal will successfully be delivered; citing past federal portals they'd been contacted about which were never delivered as well as whether TDP will present another burdensome (e.g. strict or complex access and password rotation requirements) account to juggle with the variety of others they're required to maintain.

### OFA to Grantee Email Communications

FTANF is the name of the mailbox that Tribal TANF grantees submit data and/or questions to. It is not to be confused with fTANF.exe which is the actual program that grantees can run to manage cases and convert their data to the required OFA flat file format. 

**1a. Auto Reply**

This email is the automated reply the FTNAF mailbox sends to everybody. Note the "*If* you are submitting quarterly data". The email that triggers this reply could be quarterly data, revisions to existing data, final fiscal year data, or simply a question. 

> **Automatic reply: [original subject line]**
>
> **From:** FTANFTribalDataReport (ACF)
>
> ---
>
> If you are submitting quarterly data, please accept this e-mail as initial receipt. An e-mail confirmation will be sent once your data submission has been reviewed and processed. Thank you!

**1b. Data Received**

This seems to be a manually sent email. The more "final" receipt of OFA having received data to the "initial" receipt of the auto-reply (1a). 

> **RE: [Tribe name] QTR4**
>
> **From:** FTANFTribalDataReport (ACF)
>
> ---
>
> Greetings!
>
> OFA is in receipt of your 2020-Qtr-4 (Oct – Dec) Tribal TANF data submission. We will contact you should any issues be identified during the data transfer process.
>
> From: FTANF e-mail

**2a. Missing Data Request**

This is one possible variation of "We will contact you should any issues be identified...".  In this case it seems to be about a pretty long streak of missing data for most of a fiscal year (Q1-Q3 of FY2020). 

> **Missing Data - FY2020 Q1, Q2, & Q3**
>
> **From:** FTANFTribalDataReport (ACF)
>
> ---
>
> Greetings,
>
> The Office of Family Assistance has not received your tribal TANF data for three quarters of FY2020, Q1 Jan-March , Q2 April-June, and Q3 July-September.
>
> Please submit your FY2020 Q1, Q2, & Q3 to FTANFTribalDataReport@acf.hhs.gov by Wednesday, March 24, 2021.
>
> Thank you!
>
> FTANF

**2b. Resubmission Request**

This is the other variation of follow-up in case of issues. This seems to be an instance where the grantee mistakenly submitted the wrong file for one quarter. Potential example of confusion over Fiscal Year vs Calendar Year?

> **RE: [Tribe name] Q4 2018 Resubmit**

**3. Final Fiscal Year Deadline & Data Quality Review**

Communication in this category is different from prior steps in so much as it's internal communication. From Tribal TANF OFA to regional OFA staff rather than to grantees. However, it's an important "cap" on the flow of email all the same. It contains WPR reports for a whole fiscal year, notes about any grantees who need additional attention to facilitate their correction of outstanding errors, and asks regional staff to pass on a reminder about when final Fiscal Year data is due by.

## What's next

**Immediate Next Steps**

- [Issue #804](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/804) delivered updates to the [Stakeholders and Personas document](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/User-Research/Stakeholders-and-Personas.md), including recommendations on needed personas and follow-on tickets [#840](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/840) and [#841](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/841) which respectively relate to research focused around grantee program directors and regional specialists.

**Top Future Validations**

- What are grantees used to when it comes to access management?
- Are there any pain points that popular case management tools create for Tribes?
- What reports do STTs want to see outside of WPR (Work Participation Rate)? How do grantees use and act on those reports? Are there valuable reports we could make available in-app that don't just duplicate reporting tribes already have?
- How might we make email notifications more actionable? Where are useful places with TDP for notifications to link to?
