### Who we talked to

We recruited Grantees based primarily on the following criteria:
- Moderate error rate from previous data submissions
- Previously expressed interest in participating in research sessions

The research session consisted of the following grantees:
- 2 States
- 3 Tribes
___

### What we did

The goals of conducting this research was to:

- Utilize the findings/insights from the Research Summary - Header Errors and conduct a usability review
- Explore how Grantees interpret the newly written error code descriptions based on the top error codes
- Inform the product direction on how to help Grantees resolve the errors on their own before re-submission
- Continue exploring the various ways that states and tribal programs interact for TANF data file submissions

___

### What we tested
During this research session, we wanted to simulate the future experience of the transmission report (error report) with the Grantee. The following represents the tasks that were conducted and observed.
- Request and receive approved access to TDP
- Upload and Submit Section 1 TANF data file
- Receive email confirmation of receipt of Section 1
- Execute and send via email to the Grantee with newly formatted transmission report in a .txt extension
- Allow time for the Grantee to resolve the errors on their own
- Grantee to resubmit Section 1 TANF data file back in for review
___

### What we learned

Jump to:
* [Overall initial feedback of TDP, transmission report and process](#Overall-initial-feedback-of-TDP,-transmission-report-and-process)
* [Preference towards a more timely response post data submission](#Preferenc-towards-a-more-timely-response-post-data-submission)
* [Discovered a new data administration workflow between state and certain tribal program(s)](#Discovered-a-new-data-administration-workflow-between-state-and-certain-tribal-program(s))


#### Overall initial feedback of TDP, transmission report and process

> "Everything seems to be where I can understand it" - Tribal Program
> "Pretty straightforward, there's nothing too complicated about it, it's easy to navigate through" - Tribal Program
> "This is awesome. This is super sleek" - Tribal Program

#### Preference towards a more timely response post data submission
- A confirmation email upon data file submission helps to provide confidence that submissions have been received
> "Sometimes it was a shot in the dark, because I would submit and then I wouldn't hear back sometimes months later" - Tribal Program
> "I wasn't notified that he information was "taken" but it was from my executive director - it was a hit and miss situation" - Tribal Program

#### Discovered a new data administration workflow between state and certain tribal program(s)
- A result of speaking with one of the tribal programs that submit through their state we were able to better understand their current workflow. In addition, this also helps inform the way we engage and provide support on their transition to TDP.

> "We submit an excel spreadsheet to the state and they are submitting for us"
> "We have a Tribal TANF Codebook we use that to manage the cases - not necessarily familiar with TDP error examples, but does recognize them as what they are and sees the connection"
___

### What's next
- **[February 2023]** Pilot expansion for the February 15 data submission deadline
