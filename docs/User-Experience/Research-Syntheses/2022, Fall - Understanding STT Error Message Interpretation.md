### Who we talked to

We recruited grantees based primarily on the following criteria:
* Grantees that had previously expressed interest in participating in research sessions
* Based on the error report by STT, identified the top STTs generating errors in 2021 for Section 1 - Active Cases
* Submitted data file types (TANF or SSP-MOE) to insure appropriate coverage

Participants that scheduled included
* 4 States
* 1 Tribe

___

### What we did

The goals of conducting this research were to:

- Utilize the findings/insights from the Research Summary - Header Errors and conduct a usability review
- Explore how Grantees interpret the newly written error code descriptions based on the top error codes
- Inform the product direction on how to help Grantees resolve the errors on their own before re-submission

___

### What we tested

We wanted to review examples of error communication language and layout to determine which elements enabled the grantees to locate and correct an error.

Each grantee was presented with two errors to review and provide feedback. Below is an example of the current and the revised error message.

Each grantee was asked to examine and dissect the context, and identify components of the error message output that would help aide in correcting the error.

#### Current sentiment of the existing error message(s)

![](https://i.imgur.com/O0Ko0kr.png)


> "when I see just this top error (legacy one) it makes me feel anxious and I would have to flip through and look for the answers"

> "I've been doing this a year and a half now and it's still the most cumbersome [to flip back and forth and figure out what it's trying to tell me]"

> "Depending on the amount [of errors] if it were just a handful 5-6 —it would probably take me about 3-4 hours to correct [because of all the lookup/decoding time before correction is possible]"

#### Elements of the error message to aide in correcting errors

Table layout
> "I like Error #1 because it appears to take the guesswork out with the table it seems to spell it out for me better" Just having this table would be Awesome!"

For More Details
> "the details link is good for new folks"

Displaying the full details
> "I really like seeing all of this laid out...this bottom half (new version) would be really useful and [time saving] for me" Nothing missing that would be useful to have. Nothing extra that's not adding anything to the error."

#### Comparing between descriptions in full versus the subset within the error code

![](https://i.imgur.com/mRzU54B.png)


> "I'm a why person—why was it coded this or why was it left blank. If it was all in one place it would be easier for me instead of flipping back and forth—and even for a new person coming in if it were all in one place"

> "Listing all of them would probably be more helpful—in my own opinion I'd just like to be able to learn more about it at a time...sometimes knowing which ones AREN'T supposed to be there is important so that you can learn..."

> "Would prefer to see all the options in case there is additional information that needs to be considered down the line"

#### Other challenges grantees face with regards to their current process
> We use Winscape/WinSCP and they require us to have staticIP for submissions and resubmissions downline. If we can just get this requirement removed it would be much easier for us to transmit files to ACF.

> reducing the time it takes the receive back the error report timing from "2-4 weeks"
