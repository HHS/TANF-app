# 2020, Summer - Understanding the OFA Experience

[Issue #113](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/113)





# What We Wanted to Learn



## Goals

We wanted toâ€¦

1. Determine OFA&#39;s view of &quot;Best Practices&quot; regarding TANF report submission from STTs.
2. Identify which errors and / or omissions most frequently lead to resubmission / manual data correction efforts.
3. Evaluate usability of core Admin UI tasks



## Expected Outcomesâ€¯

We expected to learn:â€¯

- Best practices from OFA&#39;s perspectives for TANF report creation and submission.
- Understand data points that cause poor data quality and how they mitigate that through resubmission.
- From the OFA&#39;s perspective, determine STTs pain points and frustrations when creating and resubmitting TANF reports
- Admin user interface meets expectations

# Who We Talked To

We wanted to talk to OFA analysts who had well-rounded experience with and exposure to a variety of administrative tasks and data submission scenarios. Specifically, we worked with the TDP Product Manager to recruit members of the OFA data team whoâ€¦

- Could authoritatively speak to the process of receiving TANF data submissions from STTs.
- Work regularly with STTs to resubmit TANF data as a result of data errors and quality issues.
- Had experience with territories and tribes in addition to states.

We interviewed 3 OFA Analysts in total.





# What We Did



## Interviews

We conducted 3, 90-minute remote interviews with OFA Analysts

- The first 60-70 mins was used as a Q&amp;A.
- The remaining time was used for concept testing with initial admin UI mockups.â€¯
- 2 of the three interviewsâ€¯were recordedâ€¯to fill out notes. (NOTE: the participants had the opportunity to opt out of recordingâ€¯the sessions).
- The recordings were password protected then made available to the user research team to augment notes.
- As soon as notes were augmented, the videos were deleted.



## OFA Synthesis Workshop

After drafting a top-level synthesis of our observations, we conducted a workshop with the members of the team who participated in the interviews to expand on the top-level synthesis, co-create insights based on the observations and brainstorm project impacts.

| Observations / Insights                                      | Project Impacts                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Best Practices â€“ Report Submission**<br />* Alerting OFA when STTs submit data may increase OFA efficiency would likely reduce ambiguity &amp; repetitive manual communication. <br />* If &quot;fatal errors&quot; were more informative at the outset, Analysts would need to spend less time investigating. <br />* STTs that have more capacity (e.g. resources, funds, tools, etc.) are more likely to fix data errors. Updated training docs (for how to help STTs) would reduce OFA time/effort when assisting STTs.  <br />* Updated training docs (for how to help STTs) would reduce OFA time/effort when assisting STTs.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> | **Potential TDRS Features**<br />* Consider including notification functionality for OFAs when STTs submit their data.<br />* Consider including logic that helps explain the nature of fatal errors.<br />* Though the quality and quantity of training material is not in the scope of the TDRS project, we may want to consider adding a way to access training resources from the OFA admin view.<br />* Consider the learning curve of the new system we&#39;re designing and building and avoid introducing new &quot;hurdles&quot; from a training standpoint.<br /><br />**Future Research**<br /><br />* Interview STTs who represent different levels of engagement to gain a deeper understanding of what engagement is, what leads to data errors, validate engagement hypotheses (e.g. more engagement = fewer errors)<br />* Look for opportunities for the TDRS project to reduce errors for low-engagement STTs. |
| **Data Points That Cause Poor Data Quality**<br />* File names, headers, and trailers are often problematic.<br />* Larger reports (with lots of data) present the most opportunities for error.<br />* STTs store data differently from one another which leads to errors in coding. <br />* OFA analysts cite inconsistent errors from the system.<br /><br /> | **Potential TDRS Features**<br />* Consider self-service features for helping STTs understand, diagnose, and fix their own errors as a way to mitigate the risk of errors due to STT data storage differences, larger reports, file names, headers & trailers. <br /><br />**Future Research**<br />* Make sure tribes are represented in STT research to understand specific differences in submission.<br />* Investigate the nature of inconsistent errors. |
| **Perceptions of STT Pain Points**<br />* No feedback mechanisms exist to inform STTs about the status of their submission. <br />* High turnover in some STTs leads to higher error rates.<br />* Lack of training/resources.<br /><br /><br /><br /> | **Potential TDRS Features**<br />* Consider including notification functionality for STT data submission such as submission status and data errors. <br />* Though the quality and quantity of training material is not in the scope of the TDRS project, we may want to consider adding a way to access training resources from the STT view.<br /><br />**Future Research**<br />* Validate OFA perceptions during STT research |
| **Perceptions of Admin User Interface**<br />* The columns/data for each user seem adequate.<br />* The role of "Data Prepper" seems too generic.<br />* The list of users was seen as being potentially helpful for communication purposes.<br />* There *is* a need to be able to filter the information in the admin screens in different ways. <br /><br /><br /> | **Potential TDRS Features**<br />* Maintain the current fundamental structure and organization of the screen design.<br />* Represent nuances to the Data Prepper role.<br />* Consider including contact mechanisms for each user.<br />* Include mechanisms for viewing data by region as well as individual STTs.<br /><br />**Future Research**<br />* Investigate nuances to the Data Prepper role. |





# Next Steps

Based on these observations, insights and impacts, we have added the following issues to the backlog

- [Get a tour of OFA resource mailbox to determine whether access is needed #167](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/167)
- [Finalize user research goals for STT research #226](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/226)
- [Draft expected outcomes for STT research #227](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/227)


Additionally, our plan is to add issues to the product backlog to explore the following:

- Notification functionality for OFAs when STTs submit their data
- Logic that helps explain the nature of fatal errors to OFAs
- Adding a way to access training resources from the OFA admin view.
- Self-service features for helping STTs understand, diagnose and fix their own errors
- Notification functionality for STT data submission such as submission status and errors
- Adding a way to access training resources from the STT view
- Represent nuances to the Data-Prepper role in the UI
- Contact mechanisms for each user in the OFA Admin view
- Mechanisms for viewing data by region as well as individual STTs
