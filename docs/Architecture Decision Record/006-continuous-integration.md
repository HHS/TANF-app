Date: 2021-08-04

## Status

Accepted

## Context

CircleCI has a FedRAMP ATO on file. It is used to automate builds, testing, and deploys from GitHub.

## Decision

We will use CircleCI as our continuous integration platform.

## Consequences
Using CircleCI for continuous integration and deployment  (CI/CD) will make the ATO process simpler.
