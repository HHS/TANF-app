## RA-05 - VULNERABILITY SCANNING

The organization:  
a. Scans for vulnerabilities in the information system and hosted applications [Assignment: organization-defined frequency and/or randomly in accordance with organization-defined process] and when new vulnerabilities potentially affecting the system/applications are identified and reported;  

b. Employs vulnerability scanning tools and techniques that facilitate interoperability among tools and automate parts of the vulnerability management process by using standards for:  
   1. Enumerating platforms, software flaws, and improper configurations;  
   2. Formatting checklists and test procedures; and  
   3. Measuring vulnerability impact;  

c. Analyzes vulnerability scan reports and results from security control assessments;  

d. Remediates legitimate vulnerabilities [Assignment: organization-defined response times] in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk; and  

e. Shares information obtained from the vulnerability scanning process and security control assessments with [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] to help eliminate similar vulnerabilities in other information systems (i.e., systemic weaknesses or deficiencies).  

### TDP Implementation

	a. Security scanning is completed using OWASP ZAP scans and Snyk dependency scanning every [how often is this scanned?] [Is this scanned as needed, when changes are made?]   
	b. A  
	c. A  
	d. A  
	e. A  
	f. A
