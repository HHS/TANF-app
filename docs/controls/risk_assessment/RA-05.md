b. Conducts an e-authentication risk assessment (ERA), as required, on systems and determine e-authentication assurance levels.  
c. Documents risk assessment results in the Security Assessment Report;  
d. Reviews risk assessment results within every 365 days;  
e. Disseminates risk assessment results to OpDiv-designated personnel; and  
f. Updates the risk assessment report before issuing a new Authority to Operate/authorization, or whenever there are significant changes to the information system or environment of operation (including the identification of new threats and vulnerabilities), or other conditions that may impact the security state of the system, or if none of these events occur, every three (3) years.  
Note: The annual review of the risk assessment results should be documented and acknowledged by the System Owner.
