[This migration](tdrs-backend/tdpservice/users/migrations/0006_auto_20201117_1717.py) 
adds three roles by which privileged use will be established. Users without a role
will be able to log in and request access, but that is all. Users assigned the
`Data Prepper` role will have the most basic set of privileges, allowing them to 
upload and manage files for their specific STT. Users assigned the `OFA Analyst` role
will have broader access than Data preppers and the `OFA Admin` role will provide 
full administrative access, except for the ability to assign an `OFA Admin` role
to a user. The will only be allowed for the built in Django role `SuperUser`.
