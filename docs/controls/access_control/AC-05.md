### TDP Implementation

**Part a.**  
Software development and maintenance is separated through the following:
* Developers will deploy new code through GitHub, initiating the continuous integration process through Circle CI.
* System owner manages the account access. Additionally, System owner provisions a new user account on request.

Data creation and control action can be completed through the TDP application by a user who has been authenticated and is active in the system. These roles include OFA admin and STT users. 
* STT/Data Preppers collect TANF data and transmit final data to OFA through the TANF application
* OFA admins have the ability to upload data on behalf of STTs and upload data files locally into the web application. 
* These users cannot provision new accounts and do not have access to the account management functionality.
