### TDP Implementation  
TDP is configured to log out users out after 30 minutes of inactivity.  

If there has been 20 minutes of inactivity, TDP will alert the user that the session will time out soon and give them the option to either extend the session or logout of the system. If the user chooses to extend the session, TDP will refresh the session. If the user elects to log out of the system it will end the session and log the user out of the system.  The user will have three (3) minutes to select an option.  If no option is selected within the three (3) minutes, the user is automatically logged out of the system and returned to the TDP home page.
