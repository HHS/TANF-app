### TDP Implementation  
TDRS is configured to log out users out after 30 minutes of inactivity.  

If there has been 20 minutes of inactivity, TDRS will alert the user that the session will time out soon and give them the option to either extend the session or logout of the system. If the user chooses to extend the session, TDRS will refresh the session. If the user elects to log out of the system it will end the session and log the user out of the system.
