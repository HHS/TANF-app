## IA-05(02) - PKI-BASED AUTHENTICATION 

The information system, for PKI-based authentication:  
(a) Validates certifications by constructing and verifying a certification path to an accepted trust anchor including checking certificate status information;  
(b) Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key;  
(c) Maps the authenticated identity to the account of the individual or group; and  
(d) Implements a local cache of revocation data to support path discovery and validation in case of inability to access revocation information via the network.
