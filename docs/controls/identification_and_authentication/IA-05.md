# Identification and Authentication
## IA-05 - AUTHENTICATOR MANAGEMENT

The organization manages information system authenticators by:  
a. Verifying, as part of the initial authenticator distribution, the identity of the individual, group, role, or device receiving the authenticator;  
b. Establishing initial authenticator content for authenticators defined by the organization;  
c. Ensuring that authenticators have sufficient strength of mechanism for their intended use;  
d. Establishing and implementing administrative procedures for initial authenticator distribution, for lost/compromised or damaged authenticators, and for revoking authenticators;  
e. Changing default content of authenticators prior to information system installation;  
f. Establishing minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and reuse conditions for authenticators;  
g. Changing/refreshing authenticators [at least every 60 days; PIV (smart card) certificates must be renewed every five (5) years];  
h. Protecting authenticator content from unauthorized disclosure and modification;  
i. Requiring individuals to take, and having devices implement, specific security safeguards to protect authenticators; and  
j. Changing authenticators for group/role accounts when membership to those accounts changes.
