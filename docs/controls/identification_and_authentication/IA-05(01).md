# Identification and Authentication
## IA-05(01) - PASSWORD-BASED AUTHENTICATION

The information system, for password-based authentication:  
(a) Enforces minimum password complexity of [characters from each of the following four categories, as provided in the application or operating system schema:  
• Uppercase letters (e.g., A, B, C, Y, Z, etc.)  
• Lowercase letters (e.g., a, b, c, y, z, etc.)  
• Special characters (e.g., ! @, #, $, %, ^, &, etc.)  
• Numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.)  
Passwords must not contain any of the following:  
• Dictionary words (e.g., computer, work) or common names (e.g., Betty, Fred, Rover).  
• Portions of associated account names (e.g., user ID, login name).  
• Consecutive character strings (e.g., abcdef, 12345).  
• Simple keyboard patterns (e.g., QWERTY, asdfgh).  
• Generic passwords (i.e., password consisting of a variation of the word “password” [e.g., P@ssw0rd1])];  
(b) Enforces at least the following number of changed characters when new passwords are created: [at least 50% of total password content must be changed when a new password is created];  
(c) Stores and transmits only cryptographically-protected passwords;  
(d) Enforces password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions of [minimum lifetime of one (1) day and a maximum lifetime of 60 days];  
(e) Prohibits password reuse for [24] generations; and  
(f) Allows the use of a temporary password for system logons with an immediate change to a permanent password.
