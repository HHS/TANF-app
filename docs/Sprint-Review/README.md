# Sprint Review Summaries

Each sprint is two weeks long. The sprint review summaries contain the following information about the work in each sprint:

    * Closed/Merged/Completed (*Done/Demo, Closed*)
    * Submitted (*QASP Review, OCIO Review*)
    * Moving to Next Sprint (*Blocked, Raft Review, In Progress, Current Sprint Backlog*)
* Agenda for Sprint Demo
