* FRA Reporting Requirements MVP | <mark style="color:green;">**ON TRACK**</mark> | Progress: 44% | Estimated Completion Date: May 15, 2025
  * <mark style="color:purple;">**Note:**</mark> The first stage of frontend development ([#3398](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sprint-board-5f18ab06dfd91c000f7e682e/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3398)) is taking longer than expected to make it to QASP review. However, as of now, this has no implications to the flow of development work. We will continue to monitor progress.
  * <mark style="color:purple;">**Note:**</mark>  We are awaiting the list of STTs that we'd like to contact about early accessing from Lauren Frohlich. We would like to send this email out to all STTs by March 1 so we can start soliciting responses.
* Regional Staff Access to TDP | <mark style="color:yellow;">**AT RISK**</mark> | Progress: 0% | Estimated Completion Date: April 22, 2025
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Potential Risk:**</mark> QASP review on the updates to the access workflow ([#3384](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sprint-board-5f18ab06dfd91c000f7e682e/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3384)) is taking longer than expected. This may delay the completion of the final training session for regional staff by a sprint.
* OFA Regional Staff UI MVP | <mark style="color:green;">**ON TRACK**</mark> | Progress: 8% | Estimated Completion Date: October 21, 2025
  * <mark style="color:purple;">**Note:**</mark> We are back on track with design ideation! Excited to share some of our designs soon :)&#x20;
* Application Health Monitoring | <mark style="color:yellow;">**AT RISK**</mark> | Progress: 45% | Estimated Completion Date: July 23, 2025
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Potential Risk:**</mark> Decommissioning Kibana/ElasticSearch ([#3363](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/laurens-product-board-6744a37f854a2c00246c2ed8/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3363)) is taking longer than expected, because the scope of work has been larger than anticipated. We are continuing to track completion and will update timelines for this epic accordingly.
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Potential Risk:**</mark> Integrating Prometheus with Mimir ([#3244](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sprint-board-5f18ab06dfd91c000f7e682e/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3244)) has been taking longer than expected, due to limitations with Cloud.gov and a lack of documentation available. We are currently exploring alternative solutions that achieve similar end results, but is causing this work to take longer than expected. We will continue to monitor progress and will update timelines for this epic accordingly.
