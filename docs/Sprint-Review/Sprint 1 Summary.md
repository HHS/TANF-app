# Sprint 1 Summary
The sprint 1 summary was delivered as a [pull request note.](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/pull/48)  

--- 
## Overview
PR to merge the user stories that were completed in Sprint 1. 

### Deliverable 1: Accepted Features
Outside of the scope of this review for Sprint 1 since this sprint focussed on Backend Scaffolding, CircleCI/CD Pipeline, addressing the comments provided in Sprint 0.
### Deliverable 2: Tested Code
Test coverage is 58%. However, a new [user story](https://github.com/raft-tech/TANF-app/issues/179) has been created to bring the test coverage up to 90% in Sprint 2. 

### Deliverable 3: Properly Styled code
Frontend ESLint is passing.

Our original settings were derived from  cookie-cutter flake8 implementations. Our `setup.cfg` file is now documented with an explanation of each setting and we've included the default settings as recommended. 

### Deliverable 4: Accessible
Pa11y is passing.

### Deliverable 7: Security
 - Zap running against the Backend API  produces the following: 
   - FAIL-NEW: 0	
   - FAIL-INPROG: 0	
   - WARN-NEW: 3	
   - WARN-INPROG: 0	
   - INFO: 0	
   - IGNORE: 0	
   - PASS: 104  

 - Zap running against the Frontend  produces the following: 
    - FAIL-NEW: 0	
    - FAIL-INPROG: 0	
    - WARN-NEW: 7	
    - WARN-INPROG: 0
    - INFO: 0

* There appears to be a benign error when executing the frontend zap scan: 
`_XSERVTransmkdir: ERROR: euid != 0,directory /tmp/.X11-unix will not be created.` This error does not interfere with any of the tests. For reference, Zap contributors discuss it [here](https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/issues/5230).
