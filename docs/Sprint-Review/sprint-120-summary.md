* FRA Reporting Requirements MVP | <mark style="color:green;">**ON TRACK**</mark> | Progress: 60% | Estimated Completion Date: May 15, 2025
  * <mark style="color:purple;">**Note:**</mark> Numerous tickets are following behind on QASP reviews (namely: [#3411](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sprint-board-5f18ab06dfd91c000f7e682e/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3411), [#3482](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/laurens-product-board-6744a37f854a2c00246c2ed8/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3482), [#3474](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sprint-board-5f18ab06dfd91c000f7e682e/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3474),  [#3473](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sprint-board-5f18ab06dfd91c000f7e682e/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3473)). Please let us know if there is anything Raft can do to expedite these reviews.
  * <mark style="color:purple;">**Note:**</mark>  Unexpected additional scope was added by the desire to treat Cat 2 errors as Cat 4 errors. We anticipate that we will be able to accomodate this change, but is manifesting in additional work required of the development team.
* Regional Staff Access to TDP | <mark style="color:yellow;">**AT RISK**</mark> | Progress: 40% | Estimated Completion Date: May 6, 2025
  * <mark style="color:purple;">**Note:**</mark>  We are still awaiting QASP review of [#3385](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/sprint-board-5f18ab06dfd91c000f7e682e/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3385) and therefore, are currently behind schedule.&#x20;
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Potential Risk:**</mark> Discussion to align on timelines for Project Updates meeting and the research planning to follow is needed. Timelines may need to slow down due to current climate.
* OFA Regional Staff UI MVP | <mark style="color:yellow;">**AT RISK**</mark> | Progress: 8% | Estimated Completion Date: October 21, 2025
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Potential Risk:**</mark> This work may be deprioritized while we work to focus on Regional Staff Access to TDP.
* Application Health Monitoring | <mark style="color:yellow;">**AT RISK**</mark> | Progress: 45% | Estimated Completion Date: July 15, 2025
  * <mark style="color:yellow;">**Potential Risk:**</mark> Decommissioning Kibana/ElasticSearch ([#3363](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/laurens-product-board-6744a37f854a2c00246c2ed8/issues/gh/raft-tech/tanf-app/3363)) has recently become unblocked and we are starting work up again, but have to refactor most of the work completed already due to changes made with the FRA parser. This delays completion timelines further for this ticket.
