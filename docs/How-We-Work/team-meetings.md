# Team Meetings

Sprints start on Wednesdays and end on Tuesdays. Therefore, sprint planning always occurs on the last day of the sprint and the day before the new sprint. Sprint Demos and Sprint Retrospectives also take place on the last day of the current sprint.

All recurring meetings can be found on this page. This page does not include adhoc pairing sessions, vendor-only meetings, tabletops, or other non-recurring meetings. The team is collaborative and often meets to solve problems together outside of typical scrum ceremonies.

A typical sprint schedule is described in the table below.
