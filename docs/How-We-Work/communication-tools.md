# Our Team Communication Tools  
 

## Mattermost 

- Chat conversation should default to the most inclusive channel to which the topic is relevant so various team members may chime in and stay up-to-date. Direct 1:1 messaging between individuals is okay if youâ€™re confident the conversation would not be helpful to others.

  - Contains sprint goals, accomplishments, and issues by status (with #s and URLs)
      - Closed/merged (Done/Demo, Closed) 
      - Submitted (QASP Review or OCIO Review)
