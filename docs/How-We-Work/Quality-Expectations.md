## Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan
We want to support a quality product through agile practices. [Please see the deliverables in the QASP of the RFQ](https://github.com/18F/tdrs-app-rfq/blob/main/Final-RFQ/FINAL-TDRS-software-development-RFQ.md)

## Contracting Officier Representative duties
CORs from both 18F and OFA will ensure that the deliverables and the quality expectations in the QASP are met. For more on the duties see the [COR duties page](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/wiki/Acquisition#contracting-officers-representative-cor)
