# Who are our users?

[We've identified a number of groups who are affected by this project](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/blob/main/docs/Product-Strategy/Vision-and-Stakeholders.md). Some of them interact with TDRS directly, and some are impacted indirectly.

The initial TDRS personas we've identified are outlined below.

More detail about each group's goals, tools, responsibilities, and pain points can be found in our [working personas mural](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/gsa6/1592254280716/2ae8293a3233a95941d548cda4f373faab96b40b).

We expect that there will be a couple hundred users who interact with the TDRS system, and it will be a mix of STT and OFA staff.
For the purposes of the OFA MVP, the only users who will have access to the application will be OFA Admin and STT (test) users.  Raft team or OFA will be acting as STT users for the OFA MVP.

### STT data preppers (STT users)

STT data preppers are in-house STT staff who collect the TANF data and get it ready for submission. Sometimes, they handle transmitting the final data to OFA, but they may also pass data on to another team member (like a supervisor or IT department) for transmission.

They may be the only person who works on reporting and has competing responsibilities like program management or administrative duties. Or, they could work on a team where there are multiple data preppers who can help with reporting.

There are a number of factors that affect the experience of a STT data prepper (and may become sub personas with more research):

- If they're a tribal grantee
- If they submit sample or universal data
- If TANF is administered by counties or the state
- If they have an integrated eligibility system
- Their availability to staff and technical resources

### STT program directors

STT program directors manage data preppers and ensure that their STT is staffed and trained to meet federal reporting requirements. They are typically less involved with data collection details and formatting, but want to make sure their teams have the tools they need to get the job done.

### Third party data preppers

We suspect that some STTs have access to systems or hire third party teams that manage their TANF data transmission for them. More research is needed in this area.

### OFA analysts

OFA analysts review, analyze, and report on STT’s TANF data that’s submitted through TDRS. They also help STTs through the transmission process.

### OFA program directors (OFA admin)

OFA program directors oversee the collection and processing of TANF data and ensure OFA analysts have what they need to do their work.

### Regional program specialists

Regional program specialists are STTs primary OFA point of contact. They track TANF trends in their region and provide troubleshooting and advice to STTs.

### OPRE analysts

OPRE studies ACF programs and the populations they serve through rigorous research and evaluation projects. They use TANF data in their analyses. More research is needed in this area, especially on where overlaps exist with OFA analysts.

### OCIO

OCIO staff oversees tech projects within ACF. They provide technical and security support to ACF's tech products.
