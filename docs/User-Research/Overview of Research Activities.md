# 2020 Fall - Understanding STT Roles, Source of Truth, and Metadata

## What we wanted to learn

### Top-level Goals 

1. Evaluate how grantees react to concept prototypes simulating TANF report creation (e.g. capturing metadata) and the uploading of associated flat files
2. Identify how grantees track the status (e.g., drafted, edited, submitted, re-submitted) of their data reports and maintain transparency of that status across their teams.
3. Document the makeup of grantee teams involved with data preparation and data submission
4. Deepen our understanding of how grantees create flat files and what causes metadata issues (including title, header, and trailer)

### Expected outcomes

1. To inform the design of high-fidelity/dev ready prototypes simulating TANF report creation (e.g. capturing metadata) and the uploading of associated flat files

2. To augment existing user stories (and create new ones) that account for designing and developing how the new TDRS will allow grantees track the status of what they submitted to OFA
3. To augment existing user stories (and create new ones) for designing and developing how the new TDRS will handle and account for additional potential STT needs (e.g. permissions/roles, turnover and external systems
4. To inform future rounds of research, enhance recruiting resources, update existing flows, process maps, prototypes, and personas.

## Who we talked to

Given the largely generative focus of this research we wanted to talk to 5-9 participants involved in TANF data preparation from a variety of grantee types. We targeted criteria such as:

- At least one state that submits universal case data
- At least one state that submits sample data
- At least one tribe
- At least one territory
- Preference toward participants who have not been interviewed in past research

## What we did

### Interviews & Concept Testing

We ended up talking to a total of six participants who fulfilled all of the above criteria. Those participants represented one tribe, one territory, and four states. Sessions ranged from 1 hour to 1 hour and 25 minutes and was equally divided into one half focused on generative interview questions regarding research goals 2-4 and one half moving through the conceptual prototypes.

### OFA synthesis workshop

After pulling verbatim quotes from research session notes/transcripts we conducted a workshop with the members of the team who participated in the interviews and OFA team members to co-create themes & insights based on the observations and brainstorm project impacts. After the workshop we captured those themes and the research supporting them in a synthesis document.

# 2020 Summer - Understanding OFA's experience

## What we wanted to learn

### Goals

We wanted to‚Ä¶

- Determine OFA's view of ‚ÄúBest Practices‚Äù regarding TANF report submission from STTs.
- Identify which errors and / or omissions most frequently lead to resubmission / manual data correction efforts.
- Evaluate usability of core Admin UI tasks

### Expected outcomes‚ÄØ

We expected to learn:‚ÄØ

- Best practices from OFA‚Äôs perspectives for TANF report creation and submission.
- Understand data points that cause poor data quality and how they mitigate that through resubmission.
- From the OFA‚Äôs perspective, determine STTs pain points and frustrations when creating and resubmitting TANF reports
- Admin user interface meets expectations

## Who we talked to

We wanted to talk to OFA analysts who had well-rounded experience with and exposure to a variety of administrative tasks and data submission scenarios. Specifically, we worked with the TDP Product Manager to recruit members of the OFA data team who‚Ä¶

- Could authoritatively speak to the process of receiving TANF data submissions from STTs.
- Work regularly with STTs to resubmit TANF data as a result of data errors and quality issues.
- Had experience with territories and tribes in addition to states.

## What we did

### Interviews

We conducted 3, 90-minute remote interviews with OFA Analysts

- The first 60-70 mins was used as the interview portion of the session.
- The remaining time was used for concept testing with initial admin UI mockups.‚ÄØ
- 2 of the three interviews‚ÄØwere recorded‚ÄØto fill out notes. (NOTE: the participants had the opportunity to opt out of recording‚ÄØthe sessions).
- The recordings were password protected then made available to the user research team to augment notes.
- As soon as notes were augmented, the videos were deleted.

### OFA synthesis workshop

After drafting a top-level synthesis of our observations, we conducted a workshop with the members of the team who participated in the interviews to expand on the top-level synthesis, co-create insights based on the observations and brainstorm project impacts.

# 2020 Spring - Digging into the local experience

## Approach

Our next round of research centered on getting a more detailed understanding of what STTs‚Äô staff experience when submitting TANF data to OFA and exploring their use of sunsetted legacy tools (the fTANF.exe application and the TDRS Extranet).

Our goals in talking to STTs were to...

- Evaluate if early design concepts give STTs the tools they need to effectively prepare valid data files to submit to OFA.
- Document how STTs currently create ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù data files to submit to OFA.
  - Identify which STTs use legacy tools to prepare TDRS submissions, what features were useful, and what caused confusion.
  - Describe how STTs validate and correct their data files before submission.
  - Document what STTs view as the beginning and the end of their data submission process.
- Document how OFA instructions are used by STTs, and how changes to those instructions would affect them and their systems.
- Identify STTs‚Äô own data reporting needs and document how they are currently accomplished

Internally, we also wanted to:

- Document what an iterative usability testing process could look like.
- Identify barriers to iterative research before a vendor comes on board.

## Findings

[Research plan and full findings here](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/wiki/2020,-Spring:-Understanding-the-local-experience)

**About the data submission process**

- There isn‚Äôt shared language between OFA and STTs on TANF data concepts and tools
- Data submitters often have years of TANF reporting experience and manage other mandated reports and data requests
- Creating flat files in fTANF is a time-consuming, ‚Äúmoody‚Äù process, but there‚Äôs also anxiety about changing something established and well-known.
- It can take multiple data sources to create a complete data submission.
- Getting data to OFA can be a collaborative effort between many people
- Creating ‚Äúa perfect file‚Äù is really hard; Data submitters have to resolve downstream data errors, meet TDRS formatting requirements, and wait a long time for feedback.
- It‚Äôs hard to confirm when and what data has been transmitted, and data submitters need that information.
- Covid-19 means adapting to new processes and distractions.
- Data submitters do a mix of importing and manual entry to build flat files, depending on the section
- The TDRS extranet is really missed, especially how it provided a way to submit data and view past data to confirm status

**About the prototypes**

- The XLS template could be a stop-gap for Sections 3 and 4, but submitters are skeptical about Sections 1 and 2.
- There were unfamiliar fields and layouts in the XLS template
- Seeing why errors happen and getting training on data rules is appreciated, but more detail is needed on where errors are happening

**How we used this research**

- We updated [our stakeholder map](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/wiki/Product-Strategy#project-stakeholders) and [user personas](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/wiki/User-types).
- We [created an updated process map](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/wiki/current-tdrs-system) to show how STTs submit data to OFA.
- Research findings contributed to [our roadmap and initial backlog](https://github.com/HHS/TANF-app/wiki/Roadmap-and-backlog).

# 2020 March - Data entry design studio

## Approach

We wanted to capture the OFA data team's ideas about what a future TDRS could look like. We...

- Focused on what a manual data input UI could look like
- Asked each team member to spend 5 minutes sketching out their ideas, and then walking the group through them

## Findings

[Design studio mural](https://app.mural.co/t/officeoffamilyassistance2744/m/gsa6/1585075302847/de1a9c20cd83c7f67c621694a736ba788eda5a97)

Insights included:

- We discussed how information flows between data layouts and how a future system could help check data across sections and perhaps even help populate data.
  - For example, Section 3 aggregate data is derived from Section 1 active report and Section 2 negative report.
  - Or, checking to see if duplicate records exist between Section 1 active report and Section 2 negative report.
- Also talked about how being able to check against data already within the system could be helpful for OFA to see changes, and perhaps could help STT prepare reports.
- Discussion around how tools like dropdowns and in-form validation could help prevent errors early; current system is free text for all inputs.
- Discussion around more conversational, plain language guidance for identifying and resolving errors.

# 2019 Fall - Discovery

## Approach

As a part of 18Fs‚Äô initial discovery research, we...

- Interviewed stakeholders across the Office of Family Assistance (OFA), as well as states, tribes, and territories (STT), to better understand their needs and perspectives.
- Mapped processes to better understand the data reporting system holistically.
- Conducted background and technical research.

## Findings

Our key findings from user research included...

- Improved data validation would have the most immediate and long-lasting impact on OFA‚Äôs work.
- The current data reporting system requires significant labor from STTs without offering them anything in return. This is more true than ever now that the extranet has been retired.
- OFA has limited insight into STTs‚Äô decision making process, or even how data moves from STTs‚Äô own systems into the format required for federal transmission.
- TDRS was built during a time of storage and processing considerations. Modern databases do not have those constraints.
- With more than 100 state, territory, and tribal programs, as well as a brittle legacy system, a careful approach to modernization is needed.

We also identified these preliminary user groups that would be served by a new TDRS:

- **Grantee admin**: Staff within the US states, territories, and tribes that receive block grant TANF funding from the federal government. These individuals are responsible for reporting data about TANF recipients to OFA through TDRS.
- **OFA analyst**: OFA staff who review, analyze, and report on grantee data submitted through TDRS.
- **Grantee program director**: Manages grantee admins and trains them on how to submit data to OFA.
- **OFA program director**: Responsible for reporting about the TANF program to Congress and other stakeholders. They also manage permissions to the TDRS system.

**How we used this research**

- This helped inform our RFQ so that we could hire a vendor to take on this work.
- Findings and architecture recommendations informed our initial coded prototype.
