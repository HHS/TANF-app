# GitHub Action Workflow
# On pull request or changes to scripts/commands or changes to the pipeline
# code to any branch besides develop, staging and master triggers the full 
# build and test pipeline.
# 
# NOTE: develop, staging(main) and master are skipped on the push because this
#       would be redundant after running the full set of tests from the PR.
#       See deploy-develop-on-merge.yml and make_erd for the workflow
#       pipelines that run on merge to develop, staging, and master branches.
#
# Step 0: make PR from your branch into develop, or make changes on your 
#         branch to non-documentation files in scripts or commands.sh and 
#         push changes to your remote branch.
#
# Step 1: Makes a request to the V2 CircleCI API to initiate the project,
#         which will filter based upon build_and_test_backend and 
#         build_and_test_frontend to run the workflow/jobs listed here:
#           build-and-test:[
#             test-backend,
#             test-frontend,
#             test-e2e
#           ]
#
#         Leverages the open source GitHub Action:
