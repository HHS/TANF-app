# HashiCorp Vault Integration Assessment

This assessment evaluates 3 Hashicorps Vault credential management patterns: Vault Static KV, Vault Dynamic Secrets, and Vault Agent. It also compares them against our current Cloud.gov/VCAP credential system.

## Integration Patterns Evaluated

1. **Cloud.gov/VCAP** (Current System) - Platform-managed credential injection
2. **Vault Static KV** - Centralized key-value secret storage
3. **Vault Dynamic Secrets** - Automatic credential generation with TTL
4. **Vault Agent** - Credential injection and lifecycle management

## Security Feature Comparison

| Feature | Cloud.gov/VCAP | Vault Static (KV) | Vault Dynamic Secrets | Vault Agent |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| Centralized storage | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Encrypted at rest | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Access control/policies | Platform-level | Fine-grained | Fine-grained | Fine-grained |
| **Automatic rotation** | **Manual** | **Manual (easy)** | **Automatic** | **Automatic** |
| Credential expiration | No | No | Yes (TTL) | Yes (TTL) |
| Unique per instance | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Immediate revocation | No | Update secret + restart | Yes (lease-based) | Yes (lease-based) |
| Audit trail | Limited | Detailed | Detailed | Detailed |
| **Credential reuse risk** | **High** | **Medium** | **Low** | **Low** |
| **Operational complexity** | **Low** | **Medium** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| Setup complexity | Low | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Production readiness | High | High | High | High |
| Credential refresh intelligence | N/A | N/A | Timer-based | Lease-aware |
| **Resource overhead** | **Lowest** | **Low** | **Medium** | **Medium** |
| Configuration complexity | Lowest | Low | Low | High |
| **Rotation downtime required** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **No** | **No** |

## Pattern Summaries

- **Vault Dynamic Secrets** - Maximum security, automatic lifecycle management
- **Vault Static (KV)** - Centralized, encrypted, fine-grained access control  
- **Cloud.gov/VCAP** - Platform-managed, better than hardcoded, but limited features

## Secret Injection/Mounting Pattern Assessment

I assessed each injection/mounting pattern for container deployment compatibility:

| Inject/Mount Pattern | Complexity | Production Ready | Dynamic |
|---------------------|------------|------------------|---------|
| Env vars | Low | High | No |
| Volume | Medium | High | Yes |
| Sidecar | Medium | High | Yes |
| **Agent** | **High** | **High** | **Yes** |

**Recommendation:** Vault Agent is recommended despite higher initial setup complexity. Vault agent reduces runtime complexity by not modifying the application. It minimizes long-term developer maintenance time, a significant advantage. 

## Rotation Strategy Compatibility

Both Vault Agent and Vault Dynamic Secrets pautomaitcally rotate credentials. This eliminates application downtime and the need for developer intervention.

| Feature | Cloud.gov/VCAP | Vault Static (KV) | Vault Dynamic Secrets | Vault Agent |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Automatic rotation** | **Manual** | **Manual (easy)** | **Automatic** | **Automatic** |
| Credential expiration | No | No | Yes (TTL) | Yes (TTL) |
| Credential reuse risk | High | Medium | Low | Low |
| Rotation downtime required | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| Credential refresh intelligence | N/A | N/A | Timer-based | Lease-aware |

## Vault Container Resource Utilization

Performance testing during migration operations showed minimal resource impact:

- Vault container: ~25-35 MiB memory, minimal CPU
- Vault-agent container: ~15-25 MiB memory, minimal CPU
- Total additional overhead: ~40-60 MiB memory

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Requirements
- **TTL configuration** needs determination for dynamic implementations (recommended: 1h default, 24h max)
- **Storage backend** Can use many different types of storage i.e S3 backend, postgres, azure, etc.
- **HVAC library** must be included in the web base image


### Implementation Tradeoffs
- Each Vault option improves upon the current Cloud.gov/VCAP solution
- Setup complexity increases in order: Static KV < Dynamic Secrets < Agent  
- Vault Agent offers better long term software maintenance.
- Some additional operational overhead for Vault infrastructure management


## Security and Compliance Considerations

- **All Vault solutions provide enhanced security** compared to the current Cloud.gov/VCAP system
- **Government compliance standards** are met by all Vault implementations
- **Fine-grained access control** available with Vault patterns
- **Comprehensive audit trails** for credential access and rotation events

## Open Questions and Recommendations

### Should we prioritize dynamic secrets or use Vault primarily as a secure K/V store initially?

**Recommendation:** Leverage dynamic secrets because of their benefits. But we will still need to use KV.

**Rationale:**
- Dynamic secrets provide superior security through automatic rotation
- Initial complexity is justified by long-term operational benefits
- Vault Agent eliminates manual credential management overhead
- Enhanced security posture aligns with government compliance requirements

### Which platform components would benefit most from early adoption?

**Priority Order:**
1. **Database credentials** (highest impact) - Immediate security improvement
2. **Third-party API tokens** - Centralized management and rotation
3. **Application configuration secrets** - Environment-specific secret management
4. **CI/CD pipeline secrets** - Secure build and deployment processes

**Implementation Strategy:** Begin with database credentials to establish Vault infrastructure, then expand to other components incrementally.

### How would credential rotation policies integrate with existing observability and alerting tools?

**Integration Approach:**
- **Vault audit logs** can be forwarded to existing log aggregation systems
- **Lease expiration alerts** can trigger notifications before credential rotation
- **Health check endpoints** can monitor Vault Agent status
- **Metrics collection** for credential usage patterns and rotation frequency
- **Dashboard integration** to visualize secret lifecycle and access patterns

**Monitoring Recommendations:**
- Track credential rotation frequency and success rates
- Monitor Vault Agent health and template rendering status
- Alert on failed credential renewals or authentication issues
- Measure application startup time impact from Vault integration

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: **Vault Agent**
Despite higher initial complexity, Vault Agent provides:
- Automatic credential rotation eliminating manual processes
- Superior security through dynamic credential generation
- HashiCorp's recommended integration pattern
- Long-term operational benefits outweighing setup complexity

### Implementation Priority
**Dynamic secrets should be prioritized** over static KV storage due to:
- Enhanced security through automatic rotation
- Reduced long-term operational overhead
- Better alignment with security best practices
- Minimal additional resource requirements once configured
