        The [DevSecOps Architecture](https://github.com/18F/gcp-appengine-template/blob/master/DEVSECOPS.md)
        describes the overall system and security architecture.  In particular, the

        section goes into details about the DevSecOps security requirements that this project
        fulfills.

        XXX Be sure to add information about your app's security architecture either here or in
