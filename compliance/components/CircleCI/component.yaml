        The CircleCI deployment pipeline for apps and infrastructure is entirely automated,
        and thus the resulting system should always reflect the code in the GitHub repo for
        the proper branch/environment and the current best
        DevSecOps practices.
        Whenever changes to the code are approved and integrated for a particular
        branch/environment, those changes are automatically rolled out.

        The CircleCI deployment pipeline configures all applications deployed with it
        by using a cloud.gov `manifest.yaml` file, which specifies every aspect of
        how the app is configured.  The pipeline automatically uses secrets and other
        configuration data that the admins manage in CircleCI, so the only manual
        configuration is that which is required to bootstrap the environment or
        which must be supplied externally.

        No configuration is ever deployed by CircleCI that is not specified in the code.

        CircleCI retains build and deploy logs for an undocumented amount of time, but
        at least 12 months.  This allows Admins to audit code deploys.

        be automatically scanned by the OWASP ZAP scanner: 
        https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project

        The CircleCI deployment pipeline for all apps deployed will
        have tests run against them so that as new deployments get deployed with
        updated runtimes to verify that the updates are non-breaking.

        These scans and tests are run in the dev/staging environments upon deployment,
        so if there are problems, they can be resolved in the lower environments before they
        reach production.

        If flaws are noticed by OWASP ZAP or the tests, CircleCI will notify the Admins.
