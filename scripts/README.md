# Scripts

The TANF app uses several scripts through its lifecycle. 
These don't all get used by or interacted with by us too often,
but some are mission critical during deployment and review of 
the application. When a developer is working on these scripts, 
they should update this documentation so future developers 
understand the role of the scripts.

# Interacting with Cloud.gov

## [set-backend-env-vars.sh](./set-backend-env-vars.sh) 

### Usage 

```bash

./scripts/set-backend-env-vars.sh CGAPPNAME_BACKEND CG_SPACE
./scripts/set-backend-env-vars.sh tdp-backend-raft tanf-dev
```

### Arguments

* `CGAPPNAME_BACKEND`: the sub domain of the app you are trying to set up environment variables for
  * Example: `tdp-backend-raft`
* `CG_SPACE`: the space the app you are trying to set up for is deployed in.
  * Example: `tanf-dev`

[A full list](../docs/Technical-Documentation/TDP-environments-README.md) of spaces and backends can be found here

### Description

Based on the provided arguments, set the appropriate environment variables on the app in Cloud.gov.

* Determines the appropriate BASE_URL for the deployed instance based on the
provided Cloud.gov App Name.
  * For example, if the app name is `tdp-backend-raft` the `BASE_URL` will get set to `https://tdp-backend-raft.app.cloud.gov/v1`.
  * If there is already an existing `BASE_URL` environment variable set, the script will use Shell Parameter Expansion to replace localhost in the URL to prevent any issues.
* Dynamically sets the `FRONTEND_BASE_URL` by replacing `backend` with `frontend` in the `BASE_URL` value.
* Dynamically generates a new `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` for each deployment. This value is generated with a python call to the `secrets` library. It is a randomly generated URL safe token that is 50 bytes in length.
* Dynamically sets `DJANGO_CONFIGURATION` based on Cloud.gov Space.
  * `tanf-prod` space results in a Django configuration of `Production`.
  * `tanf-staging` uses the `Staging` configuration
  * All other spaces use the `Development` configuration
  * This refers to the Django settings class that will be used within the `tdpservice.settings.cloudgov` module. 

### Where it's used
The script `deploy-backend` invokes this script if the `DEPLOY_STRATEGY` is `initial`, `bind` or `rebuild`. Can optionally be run locally on its own.


## [copy-login-gov-keypair.sh](./copy-login-gov-keypair.sh)

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/copy-login-gov-keypair.sh <source-app> <dest-app>
```

### Arguments

* `SOURCE_APP`: The app to copy keys from.
  * Example: `tdp-backend-raft`
* `DEST_APP`: The app to copy keys to.
  * Example: `tdp-backend-qasp`

### Description

Copies Login.gov JWT_KEY + JWT_CERT from one Cloud.gov application to another. This assumes that the user is already logged in to the Cloud Foundry CLI via the `cf login --sso` command. Both apps must exist within the same space.

### Where it's used

This script is only a convenience tool for developers, it has no direct usage in CI.


## deploy-backend.sh

### Usage

```bash
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh <strategy> <app-name>
./scripts/deploy-backend.sh rolling raft-review
```
### Arguments

```bash
# The deployment strategy you wish to employ ( rolling update or setting up a new environment)
DEPLOY_STRATEGY=${1}

possible values:
+ rolling
    deploy to a new server leaving the existing one up until the deployment has succeeded

+ bind
    Bind the services the application depends on, update the environment
    variables and restage the app.

+ initial
    There is no app with this name, and the services need to be bound to it
    for it to work. the app will fail to start once, have the services bind,
    and then get restaged.

+ rebuild
    You want to redeploy the instance under the same name
    Delete the existing app (with out deleting the services)
    and perform the initial deployment strategy.

## zap-hook.py

### Usage
This script is used in an argument passed inside of `zap-scanner.sh`. It is not used directly.

### Arguments
no args


### Description

Python hook that can be used to disable ignored rules in ZAP scans.
This hook runs after the ZAP API has been successfully started.

This is needed to disable passive scanning rules which we have set to IGNORE
in the [ZAP configuration file](../tdrs-backend/reports/zap.conf). Due to an unresolved issue with the scripts
the HTML report generated will still include ignored passive rules so this
allows us to ensure they never run and won't be present in the HTML report.
